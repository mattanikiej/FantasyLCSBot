# Discord Bot for Sleeper Fantasy LCS
## Welcome!
This is a Discord bot that can be used for Sleeper fantasy leagues. 
Although this app was created specifically for Fantasy LCS, it should work for all sports.

## Current Features
* $standings - Displays the current standings of the league
* $matchups - Displays the current matchups of the league
* Sends update every Monday on current standings
    * Also sends an update ever Fri/Sat/Sun, but this will be updated to matchup scores when Sleeper API updates
* Sends updates on new matchups every Tuesday

## Future Feature Goals (ranked in order of priority)
* Have $help documentation for server members to use
* See matchup of any specific week
* Want to display scores but Sleeper API doesn't support LCS pick/ban scoring yet
