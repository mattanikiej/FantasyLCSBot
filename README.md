# Discord Bot for Sleeper Fantasy LCS
## Welcome!
This is a Discord bot that can be used for Sleeper fantasy leagues. 
Although this app was created specifically for Fantasy LCS, it should work for all sports.

## Current Features

* $matchups - Displays the current matchups of the league

## Future Feature Goals (ranked in order of priority)
* Have bot running on Heroku server (Will get done 6/5/21 evening or 6/6/21)
* Have $help documentation for server members to use
* Provide automatic updates on matchups every Monday
* Provide automatic updates every Fri/Sat/Sun evening
* Provide automatic updates every Sunday morning on close games
* See matchup of any specific week
* Want to display scores but Sleeper API doesn't support LCS scoring yet

## Setup
